Steps for original plan:
step 1: learning how machine learning work 
step 2: exploring options
step 3: understanding how the algorithm works with the language chosen
step 4: import if needed
step 5: code!
    a. learn tensorflow and scss
    b. import tensorflow.js 
        i. import trainable machine into project 
    c. set up canva for camera to display
    d. set up answer choices
    e. page designs
step 6: deploy


Steps for Plan B
step 1: get random character to display --> function getRandomCharacters() (random charac)
setp 2: add to whatever value returned from randomCharacter() of .png (actual file name)
stpe 3: displaying the image from corresponding file name from previous step 

Array Shuffling:
displaying new questions and new possible answers 
display new answer in same function 
loops --> populate answer spots 
array --> with all the answer (abcd),. 3/4 are random letters shuffle array

Array Answer when clicked:
when user clicks on one answer --> displaying the answer

when choose right answ = green (styling attritube)
onclick => displaying color 
wrong ans = red 

!!!Displaying the right answer --> styling it centering
history bars? (bottom)
progress bars? (top)

var array = ["a","b","c","d"]; // a is correct, rest is incorrect(random) --> shuffle (Random)
          // 0    1    2   3 (RANDOM ORDERING)
var newArray = ["b","a","c","d"] //new shuffled values
//displaying correct the correct answer from left to rig11ht (loop)
// variable for storing the the image being shown



to get what button user selected: 
1. Which button is selected?
2. using that button information to make it whatever color
